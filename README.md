# EmployeeTracker

## Description

A Content Management System for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.  Users are able to view, add, delete, or update departments, employees, and employee roles within the database.

## User Story
```
As a business owner
I want to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
So that I can organize and plan my business
```
## Instructions

How do you deliver this? Here are some guidelines:

* Use the [MySQL](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql) NPM package to connect to your MySQL database and perform queries.

* Use [InquirerJs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/0.2.3) NPM package to interact with the user via the command-line.

* Use [console.table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table) to print MySQL rows to the console. There is a built-in version of `console.table`, but the NPM package formats the data a little better for our purposes.

* You may wish to have a separate file containing functions for performing specific SQL queries you'll need to use. Could a constructor function or a class be helpful for organizing these?

* You will need to perform a variety of SQL JOINS to complete this assignment, and it's recommended you review the week's activities if you need a refresher on this.

### Hints

* You may wish to include a `seed.sql` file to pre-populate your database. This will make development of individual features much easier.

* Focus on getting the basic functionality completed before working on more advanced features.

* Review the week's activities for a refresher on MySQL.

* Check out [SQL Bolt](https://sqlbolt.com/) for some extra MySQL help.

### Submission on BCS

You are required to submit the following:

* The URL of the GitHub repository

* A video demonstrating the entirety of the app's functionality
